        </div>
        <p>Welcome to the research page of Nepali chitra printing.Here we have added the websites and concepts that we used as references to complete our fully functional website. 
            This page also includes comparisons, differences, parallels, and innovations between our website and other existing websites. The primary goal of this page is to do a
            comparative examination of our website with other current existing websites.

      <h3>Similarities</h3>
        <p>
          The image on the left represents our home page, while the one on the left shows an existing website named Daraz, from which we drew inspiration when designing our home page. 
          As a reference for our website's home page, we can see some parallels between both, such as the concept of an image slider that displays several interesting deals currently 
          accessible while sliding. The locations of the logo and navigation bar are fairly identical on both websites.
        </p>
      <h3>Differences</h3>
      <p>
        Despite their similarities, there are some notable differences between the websites, such as color and theme. We can also see that our website does not include a search bar in the
        navigation bar like the other website. Our website includes a short description about our website and web pages with tansition image that other website lackks. 
      </p>
      <h3>Innovations</h3>
      <p>
        Though being  a reference website it sure does have some features that our website lacks but our website also has some features that it lacks such as the ability to switch between light 
        and dark modes. Our website also includes brief descriptions of each page, as well as links to those pages. We also have image transitions on our website.

      <h3 style="height: 46px;">Similarities</h3>
        <p>
          The image on the left reflects our website's product page, whereas the image on the left represents an existing product page from a website called Daraz, which we used as inspiration when 
          building our product page. We can see certain similarities between them, such as how each product is shown in a box with an image of the product. Both websites display a star rating, which 
          indicates the product's rating. We can also see that the discounted price is represented in the same way on both websites. 
        </p>
      <h3>Differences</h3>
      <p>
        Although having certain similarities, there are some differences between the websites like our website lacks the feature of search bar near nevigation bar. The reference website also has the 
        feature of filttering products according to brand price and rating which our website lacks. The color and theme between the 2 website is also very much different from each other. Despite the 
        fact that both websites serve as online purchasing platforms, ours solely sells printing machines.
      </p>
      <h3>Innovations</h3>
      <p>
        Although Daraz is a reference website, it does have features that stand out more than ours, but our website also has a few features that stand out more than the reference website. Our website 
        includes a function for switching between light and dark modes. Our website also does a better job showing star ratings with actual star symbols. Our website also performs better at delivering 
        minimal product data from the see more option, making it easier for clients to view printer characteristics while scrolling across pages. Also, our website makes it easier to view product warranties.

      <h2 style="font-size:4rem; text-align: left; position: relative; left: -11rem;;">Similarities</h3>
        <p>
          On the left side, we can see our blog page, and on the right, we can see an existing website HubSpot. Our blog page shares aspects with the website on the right, such as a 
          scrollable length bar near the navigation bar, image format, and text authoring structure. We can also see that both webpages have somewhat similar left and right magrin gaps.
        </p>
      <h3>Differences</h3>
      <p>
        Despite certain similarities, there are some differences between the two websites. Our website does not feature a search box near the navigation bar, unlike other websites. Our 
        website's heading format is likewise somewhat different from the other websites. Our website's navigation bar is located on the top right side, but other websites have a different 
        location. Our website also lacks the view more option that the other website has.
      </p>
      <h3>Innovations</h3>
      <p>
        Though being a reference website it sure does have some features that our webiste lacks, at some point our features also stand out from the existing website like our website has a 
        feature of converting webpages into both light and dark mode so that user can have his/her prefferd mode while scrolling through our website. Our website .
